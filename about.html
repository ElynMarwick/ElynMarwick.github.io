                        <p>
                            I coached my first functional fitness class in 2021 and since then I've been working full time as a
                            personal trainer - both online and in person. 

                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I love helping people achieve things
                            they never thought they could and I believe a focus on building measurable strength and fitness
                            should be the foundation of all programs. If you don't enjoy it and you can't see progress it 
                            is MUCH harder to stay consistent

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm also a CrossFit O-L1 where I help people scale up to
                            Rx level and beyond, building confidence, strength, and skill every step of the way. 

                        </p>

                            I've built this website while studying for my masters in Computer Science and Software Engineering at
                            Abertay University. I love problem solving and I love learning new things, so this has been a really fun
                            project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My undergraduate degree was in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow. Here I learned
                            the foundations of many algorithms I now use in computer science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm enjoying learning from great lecturers at Abertay and I hope to use my skills in the future to
                            enter into the world of software engineering and machine learning. I want to use these skills to help people and make a difference.

                            I attended my first CrossFit class in 2018, I absolutely sucked at it, but I loved it. I was hooked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started training for competitions in 2020, not with the intention of winning, but just to see some personal
                            progress. Turns out I LOVED competing, and opportunities kept coming so I kept saying yes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since then I've got to compete all over the UK, into Europe, and even in America. I've accomplished things that
                            I never even thought I'd attempt when I started and I cannot wait to see what comes next here.
                        </p>

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                This new year’s felt like a special one, partly because I was in Sydney which is one of the most iconic New Years eve destinations in the
                                world, but also because I’ve been feeling really motivated recently to achieve a little more.
                                I dragged myself to the gym (fresh air drinking hit differently) then took a big walk on the 1st to see the harbour bridge, the opera house 
                                and just explore the CBD of a city I’ve always wanted to visit. I took an hour to sit down and write about not just what I wanted from this year,
                                but how I plan to get it.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                My big, overarching goals this year are to break into a technology related graduate or junior role, improve the support I offer my online clients,
                                qualify for in-person semifinals, and spend more time seeing my friends. However, overarching goals are unfortunately useless if you don’t have daily steps
                                on how you’re going to achieve these. Most outcomes are going to be out of my control, but most actions and attitudes are very much within it.  
                            </p>

                                The common thread in all of these is controllable actions over uncontrollable outcomes. I can’t guarantee I’ll manage to get a graduate role,
                                qualify for semis, or achieve any specific training goal I’ve got my eye on, but I can commit to showing up consistently and putting the work in.
                                2026 is going to be all about doing what I say I’m going to do and feeling better for it. No expectations just head down, work hard, and enjoy the process.
